# UF High School Programming Contest 2016 Materials

This repository contains all of the materials I wrote for the 2016 UF High School Programming Contest. This includes details about my various roles: chief judge (problem set), sysadmin (network and computers), and director (planning the event). I'm currently in the progress of trying to document exactly what I did so that my roles can easily be reproduced by someone. 

# Problem Sets
The problems were all written by Joshua Kirstein and are, for those that are unfamiliar with programming contests, algorithmic programming problems that require logic, creativity, and some programming to solve.

The theme for this year's problem set was `random definitions of things'.

Practice problems gracefully stolen from the ACM SER ICPC contest. =)

# Sysadmin Guide

WIP. Guide on how to set up the network, webserver (DOMjudge and Apache), DNS (bind9), judgehosts (DOMjudge), and contestant machines (a bunch of configuration).

# Director Guide

TODO. Guide on how to plan an event!
